- **Governance Establishment**: Introduce mechanisms for community decision-making, such as proposals and voting.  
- **Education**: Provide resources to educate participants about using decentralized exchanges, wallets, and participating in governance.  
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with other DeFi projects, wallets, and exchanges to increase NATO's visibility and utility.

## ⌛ **Phase 3: Long-term Growth and Sustainability (2026 - 2030)**

- **Liquidity Pool Lock Period**: The 12% (120,000,000,000) token allocation for liquidity will remain locked until **1/1/2030**.  
- **Organic Development**: Encourage the community to create utilities, such as decentralized applications (dApps), payment solutions, or additional liquidity pools.  
- **Global Expansion**: Promote NATO’s adoption across diverse regions and demographics, focusing on financial inclusion and accessibility.  
- **Sustainability Initiatives**: Explore ways for NATO to contribute to global causes, such as environmental sustainability, education, and charitable initiatives.
